DONE: Contain at least four different .html pages, one of which is index.html
    - be able to get to any other page from eachother

DONE: use at least 10 distinct HTML tags besides <html>, <head>, <body>, and <title>
    - I am not entirely sure if by head, they mean elements in the head
    so I will split it up into head and body count


    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    - index.html
        - head: <link> <script>
        - body: <div> <a> <h1> <p> <h2>
    - blender.html
        - head: <link> <script>
        - body: <div> <a> <br> <h1> <h2> <p> <table> <tr> <td> <img>
    - trumpet.html
        - head: <link> <script>
        - body: <div> <a> <h1> <p> <h2>
    - flappy.html
        - head: <link> <script>
        - body: <div> <a> <canvas>
    - skyrim.html
        - head: <link> <script>
        - body: <div> <a> <img> <table> <tr> <td> <img>

    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    - uniques:
        - head: <link> <script>
        - body: <div> <a> <h1> <p> <h2> <br> <table> <tr> <d> <img> <canvas>

    - totals:
        - head: 2
        - body: 11

    - so we are good on the elements front (even if it did not include the head for some reason)

DONE: Bootstrap features
    - at least 1 or more

    - used the file tree explorer stylization

DONE: One custom stylesheet
    - uses at least 5 different css selectors
    - uses at least 5 different properties

    - SELECTORS:
        :root, body, html, a, a:hover, a:visited, a.folder, a.link, h1, h2, .contentContainer, .tab, .noWrap,
        .verticalSpacer, .speechBubble, .lip, .skyrimImg, #pageContainer, #tree, #content,
        #content::-webkit-scrollbar

        - I think this is larger than 5

    - PROPERTIES...
        - I don't feel like listing all of them but there is definetely more than 5


DONE: use javascript
    - lots of javascript

EYES OF THE BEHOLDER: looks good on mobile and desktop
    - I think it looks good, but other people might not like it which is the best that I can reasonably do.
    If anything, the skyrim one is a gaff, so if they think that does not look good, then don't count that one.

    - The only real issue is that in the blender html, when loading the images, the table can get a little
    quirky, but then it evens out. Overall, I think it looks great. One of my better sites
