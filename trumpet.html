                <h1>Me and my Trumpet</h1>
                <p class="tab">
                    My instrument of choice is the trumpet. I have been playing it for a very long time...
                </p>
                <h2>Beginnings</h2>
                <p class="tab">
                    I started playing trumpet when I was in 3rd grade. I picked it up because of a conversation I had with my grandma. We were in the car one day, and she asked me what instrument I wanted to learn. I randomly said trumpet and the rest is history. I started getting private lessons at this one church near to where I lived.
                </p>
                <h2>Middle School</h2>
                <p class="tab">
                    Not surprisingly, I joined band class in middle school because I already knew the trumpet. While I was in middle school, I got to go the the OSU honor band. Your band director picks out who will go to it, and mine chose me (probably becuase I already had a leg of of like 3 years before even going into middle school or something). I also did jazz band while I was in middle school
                </p>
                <h2>Marching Band</h2>
                <p class="tab">
                    In my final year of middle school, I decided to join the high school marching band? It is kind of weird because you wouldn't expect that you could, but where I lived you could for some reason (they were probably needing people...) So I went and joined that and it was really fun. It was very interesting socially speaking because, believe it or not, highschoolers to tend to be a bit more respectful than middleschoolers tend to be.
                </p>
                <p class="tab">
                    I also got a lot more acclimated with the high school, so I was not as shell shocked for when I would go it (even though that would not be too big of a deal). We would take a bus ride from the middle school to the high school in order to get to marching band practice. That year was very interesting because, even though I was quite good at trumpet, my atheletic skills were terrible. Overall, that first year introduced me to a whole new group of friends, many of which I still hang out with to this day
                </p>
                <h2>Pit Orchestra</h2>
                <p class="tab">
                    When I was in high school, I got the opportunity to join the pit orchestra for a theatre production that the theatre (no duh) was doing. So, in the last minute, I joined in on that and it was really fun. They essentially just give you this big book of music and hopefully you can play all of it from just reading it (which is a really good skill to obtain called sight-reading). I proceeded to do around 6 more shows after that (not all at our high school, but some at different high schools in the district).
                    One of these was really cool because the people playing in it (other than me) were not in high school but were professionals or just out of highschool. I really need to do another one of those...
